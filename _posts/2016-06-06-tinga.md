What is the purpose of the existence of this thing called TINGA that hangs around on the worldwideweb?

TINGA is the short name for 'Things I'll Never Greet Again' A collection of memorable events that should not be forgotten, even when I go, TINGA will still be here(or well for as long as the Grid allows it to live)

Everything on here is something memorized by someone who will be gone sooner than the places in the memories will ever vanish, who will be gone sooner than the tastes from the memories will perish, the sounds from the memories will silence or the astonishing views from these memories will fade.
